# Help system
- Implemented help system. Use !help to get help, !help models to list models, and so on.
  You can also ask it questions in English, but it's not very smart.
- Implemented changelog.

# Models
- SDXL 1.0 is out, and now the default model. 0.9 is still available as `-m sdxl_0.9`.
- Added AstraeaPixie_Radiance v1.6 as `-m AstraeaPixie`.
  This is tuned for high quality anime portraits, but becomes a more vanilla model with --np.
