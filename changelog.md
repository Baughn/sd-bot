# Help system
- Implemented help system. Use !help to get help, !help models to list models, and so on.
  You can also ask it questions in English, but it's not very smart.

# Infrastructure
- Initial LoRA support. For now just gives a quality boost.

# Models
- Default model swapped to DarkPizzaXL, aka. `-m AnimeXL`. It does most things, in anime style. Browse the model selector for alternatives.
- Added Dreamshaper alpha2, also aliased as `-m Realistic`. This is intended for photorealistic outputs. Plus dragons.
- Added duchaitenxl. This is a semi-photorealistic model tuned for aesthetics. Use English descriptions, not tags.
- Added rundiffusionxl. This is a photorealistic model, intended for various forms of fantasy art. Use English, not tags.
- Added breakdomainxl. This is a stylized anime model, by Jemnite, but unlike most of them is happy to draw less-pretty things; which will still be drawn well.
