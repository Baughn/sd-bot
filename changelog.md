# Help system
- Implemented help system. Use !help to get help, !help models to list models, and so on.
  You can also ask it questions in English, but it's not very smart.

# Models
- Added AstraeaPixie_Radiance v1.6 as `-m AstraeaPixie`.
  This is tuned for high quality anime portraits, but becomes a more vanilla model with --np.
- Added Dreamshaper alpha2, also aliased as `-m Realistic`. This is intended for photorealistic outputs. Plus dragons.
- Added AstreaPixieXL. Use danbooru tags... but this is still XL, so it understands English pretty well.
  This is now aliased as `-m AnimeXL`.
